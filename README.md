# stock_strategies
This repo seeks to mirror some of James O'Shaughnessy's strategies outlined in his book 'What Works on Wall Street'
Please let me know if you find any bugs in the code, and as always, do your own backtesting and research before implementing
these strategies.  These scripts are not intended to be a substitute for doing your own research, and I cannot guarantee that
they follow O'Shaughnessy's exact strategies.  This is still very much a work in progress. Basically what I'm trying to say is
that if you lose money based on the stock picks from my code, it's not my fault :)
